# Private Market Api

**There** are several markey api which are available on onternet. Some of their features would be available for free while others can be purchased.
My work made me try out a lot of market api and choose those having best features under best price. 
Some of the market Api that i worked on are Alphavantage, Alpaca, Polygon, Twelvedata.
To use several features of these api, codes are available in this repository.
There is also codes for several features of pandas/numpy that are used to control the output format using these market api.
